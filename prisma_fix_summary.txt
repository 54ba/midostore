The Prisma schema has been successfully updated and validated for PostgreSQL.

Summary of changes:
1.  **Database Provider Change:** Switched from `sqlite` to `postgresql` as the database provider in `prisma/schema.prisma`.
2.  **Ambiguous Relation Fixes:**
    *   `UserPrimaryAddress` relation: Added `primaryAddressId String? @unique` to `User` and properly defined the one-to-one relation with `Address`.
    *   `UserAddresses` relation: Explicitly named the inverse relation in `Address` model.
    *   `UserPreferencesSetting` relation: Ensured correct one-to-one relation between `User` and `UserPreference` by explicitly defining `userId` in `UserPreference` and its relation.
    *   Removed `User.userPreferences` to simplify the preference model to a one-to-one relationship.
    *   `Address.orders`: Replaced generic `orders Order[]` with specific `billingOrders Order[] @relation("BillingAddress")` and `shippingOrders Order[] @relation("ShippingAddress")`.
    *   Removed `Order.trackingInfos` as it was a nested relation.
    *   Added opposite relations for `CartItem.variant`, `Review.order`, `CryptoPayment.order`, `Shipment.supplier`, and `P2PListing.product`.
    *   Removed duplicate `cryptoPayments` field from the `Order` model.
3.  **Prisma v7 Compatibility & Simplified Build Process:**
    *   **Permanently removed `url = env("DATABASE_URL")` from the `datasource db` block in `prisma/schema.prisma`**. This is to ensure `npx prisma generate` passes during the build process, as Prisma v7 explicitly states `url` is no longer supported in `schema.prisma` for `generate`.
    *   The dynamic pre/postbuild scripts (`scripts/generate-env-config.js` and `scripts/readd-prisma-url.js`) and associated `package.json` modifications have been **removed**.
    *   **Crucially, `prisma migrate deploy` (the release command) MUST rely solely on the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable being correctly set and accessible in the Fly.io environment.**
4.  **env.config.ts Management:** The `env.config.ts` file needs to be manually managed or generated by the user's build process if direct imports are used. For now, it is assumed that Fly.io's build process handles the environment variables for Next.js.
5.  **MongoDB URI Configuration:** Added a placeholder `MONGODB_URI` to the `.env` file to satisfy the application's requirement for a MongoDB connection string during the build process.
6.  **Typo Fix:** Corrected a typo (`cl!ssName` to `className`) in `src/components/EnhancedDashboard.tsx`.

The `npx prisma generate` command should now run successfully during the Docker build.

**ACTION REQUIRED:** You must ensure your Fly.io app's environment is correctly configured:
1.  **Ensure `DATABASE_URL` secret is correctly set in Fly.io.** This is *critical* for `prisma migrate deploy` to connect to your PostgreSQL database. (As instructed previously, using `flyctl secrets set DATABASE_URL='your_postgresql_connection_string' -a midostore-oumala`).
2.  **Verify your Fly.io build command configuration:** Ensure it is configured to run `npm run build`. This ensures all `package.json` scripts are honored. (Check Fly.io app settings or documentation for how to specify the build command).

After you've configured the Fly.io environment, please retry your `flyctl deploy` command.
